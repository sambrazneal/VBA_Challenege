# VBA_Challenege
Module 2 - VBA 

## Overview of Project 
Steve is a recent finance graduate, and his parents want to be his first clients. Steve came to us for help analyzing a data set of stocks over two years. Throughout this module, we analyzed the stocks for Steve to present to his parents. In this challenege, our main goal was to refactor, or edit, the code we created in the module to be more efficent. Our final result was a user-friendly excel workbook for 2017 and 2018 for Steve to present to his parents to help them make an informed decision for their investment. 

## Results 
We found that there were only two stocks that remained profitable in 2017 and 2018. Those stocks were ENPH and RUN. Unfortunately for Steve's parents, DQ only generated a positive return in 2017.
